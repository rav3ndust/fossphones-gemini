# fossphones-gemini

FOSSphones on the Gemini protocol. Because we're cool like that. 

All of the pages are officially copied over! FOSSphones is now available via Gemini and the standard web. It can be accessed over Gemini at: 

> gemini://fossphones.com

This repository is where I will be keeping all the .gmi files and related stuff. 

## Wanna help?

Got any ideas for articles about Linux Phones or other FOSS mobile stuff (such as free Android distributions like [LineageOS](https://www.lineageos.org/) or [GrapheneOS](https://grapheneos.org/))? Or a piece of FOSS mobile news we might have missed? Found some cool FOSS mobile apps we should know about? Did you notice a typo or a [404](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_404) from one of our pages?

Please feel free to write up an article (*include your name, nickname, and contact handle*) if you want to have it posted on the Gemini and Web versions of FOSSphones. We are always happy to share any content about Linux Phones with the world. Just format your article in HTML or gemtext and send it over through a pull request - I will check it out and merge it. :) 

If you hear about something but don't want to bother with the PR process, just hit us up on the [Fediverse](https://neighborli.xyz/@FOSSphones) or on [X](https://x.com/FSphones) with the information, and we'll get it included in the next FOSSphones roundup!
